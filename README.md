## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Duplicate the `.env.template` file and rename the copy to `.env`. Update the `VITE_FLOWMAP_CITY_TOKEN` variable in `.env` with your access token (can be obtained from [Flowmap City](https://www.flowmap.city)).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies and Run the Project

Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
yarn        # Install project dependencies
yarn dev    # Start the development server
```
